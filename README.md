# 02-bootstrap-grid

This project is the first iteration of my portfolio, utilizing what we have learned so far in the course along with self study material.  

I have created a Home page with a quick bio, an image and links to connect with me and my portfolio. 

My portfolio contains a link to my resume and a page that I did not complete on time but it was to contain a little more in depth info on my background and personal life.  

The connect page contains links to my professional social media and direct links to my email.  

Each page is mobile responsive and contain the same general layout and navbars.
